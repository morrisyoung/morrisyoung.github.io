    <dt>Fast IBD Extraction from Ancestral Recombination Graphs <a href="https://github.com/morrisyoung/IBDdetection", target="_blank">[code]</a></dt>
    <dd>Identity by Descent (IBD) segments are well defined as the long haplotype sharing between two individuals in a cohort. There are lots of IBD related research works, both in theoretical aspect and applied aspect. In all of these works, a very important problem is that, we always need some ground true IBD segments as the reference. This work is focused on extracting these ground true IBD segments directly from ancestral recombination graphs (ARG), in an efficient manner. This work will become an helpful tool for other related research, like theory verification of IBD, simulation based approach for demographic inference.

  <p>Shuo's hometown is <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qingdao", target="_blank">Qingdao</a>, a very beautiful coastal city in eastern China. Though growing up beside the sea, embarrassingly he can't swim.</p>
  <p>Shuo was once crazy about heavy metal in his undergraduate, especially for <a href="http://www.metallica.com/", target="_blank">Metallica</a>. He and his brothers organized a band, called "Cubic Band", which means extremely cool in Chinese. Thouth it's only a very small band and not very professional, and they had only several small performance, those are all life-long memory for him.</p>
  <p>Shuo likes basketball, though playing basketball was only his high school thing. He likes Michael Jordan very much, like many people else. He is inspired by Jordan's passion about what he loves, and Shuo also wants to be a man like that, passionate and dedicated for what he wants to do and to be in his life.</p>
